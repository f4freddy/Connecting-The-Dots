# Connecting-The-Dots
The purpose of this project is to create an opensource, community-driven inventory management system
for requesting and distributing inventories on calamities like flood etc..
The inspiration for this project is coming from the recent floods in Kerala,
where lots of people are ready to help and donating many bits of help,
but no decent management system is not fount to distribute them.
Because of this many items not get whom they needed and those items reached places they not required at all.
So smart inventory management can ensure help reaching on correct hands when they needed.
