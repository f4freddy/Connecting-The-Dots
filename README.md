# Connecting-The-Dots
The purpuse of this project is to create a opensorce, community driven inventory managment system for 
requsting and distributing invenotries on calamities like flood etc..
THe inspiration for this project is came from the recent floods in kerala,where loats of people are 
ready to help and donating many helps,but no decent management system is not fount to distribute them. 
Because of this many items not get whoom they needed and thos items reached places they not required at all.
So a smart inventory management can ensure help reaching on currect hands when they needed.
